The goal of this project is to collect data from an Accelerometer glued on the top of a Washing Machine and try to predict whether the Washing Machine is turned off, is centrifuging a heavy load (like two big blankets), or is centrifuging a light load (like some light towels).

To collect the data, I used [Edge Impulse](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com) and an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board.  
For more information on how to use this board to collect data with Edge Impulse, please check [this documentation](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense).  

This project is inspired by the course "Introduction to Embedded Machine Learning", available in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-embedded-machine-learning).
