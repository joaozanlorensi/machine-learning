## What is Machine Learning?
#### *(from Andrew Ng's course, in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), a definition created by Arthur Samuel)*
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## What are the most popular classes of Machine Learning algorithms?

Machine Learning Algorithms are essentially divided in three major classes:

> **Supervised Learning**
> A *Supervised Learning* algorithm uses labeled historical datasets as training datasets to find forecasts or outcomes. It counts on Direct Feedback, meaning that the training datasets are able to sirve as a reference to evaluate the answers given by the algorithm.
> Supervised Learning algorithms are divided between Regression and Classifications algorithms.
>  Classification algorithms aim to predict discrete values. Regression algorithms, on the other hand, aim to predict continuous values.

> **Unsupervised Learning**
> An *Unsupervised Learning* algorithm, on the other hand, does not use historical answers nor labels to predict values or outcomes, and is fully based in finding hidden structures or patterns in data.

> **Reinforcement Learning**
> A *Reinforcement Learning* algorithm, finally, is directly bounded to a decision process. It has a feedback system based in rewarding and is targeted to learning a sequence of actions.
