# Machine Learning
This repository gathers scripts and concepts that I referenced, wrote and studied about Machine Learning, based in a wide variety of sources.
My goal is to make it a comprehensive guide to anyone who wants to study Machine Learning!

The main references used in this Repository are listed below:
1. [Prof. André E. Lazzaretti's wonderful classes of Machine Learning (Federal University of Technology – Paraná)](https://sites.google.com/site/andrelazzaretti/undergraduate-courses/introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-%C3%A0-modelagem-e-aprendizado?authuser=0)
2. [Prof. Sebastian Raschka's classes on Introduction to Machine Learning (University of Wisconsin–Madison)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTKMiZHVd_2KyGirGEvKlniaWeLOHhUF3)
3. [Prof. Andrew Ng's classes on Machine Learning (University of Stanford)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)


It is important to note that all of them are made available **for free** on the internet, a really great privillege to us who aim to study Machine Learning!
