# machine-learning
Repository with some useful materials that I wrote and studied during my Machine Learning classes at UTFPR, based in the wonderful materials provided by Prof. Andr√© Lazzaretti (https://sites.google.com/site/andrelazzaretti/). My goal is to make it a comprehensive guide to anyone who wants to study Machine Learning!
