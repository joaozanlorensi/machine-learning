# machine-learning
Repository with scripts that I wrote and studied during my Machine Learning classes at UTFPR, based in the wonderful lectures given by [Prof. Andr√© E. Lazzaretti](https://sites.google.com/site/andrelazzaretti/). 
My goal is to make it a comprehensive guide to anyone who wants to study Machine Learning!
