This folder contains my solution to the [Fall Detection challenge](http://fenix.univ.rzeszow.pl/~mkepski/ds/uf.html), from the University of Rzeszowski.  
The documentation in their website provides great explanation on it.   
The goal of this challenge is to detect and forecast falls based in accelerometer sensors data.  
Two different types of datasets are used to forecast falls: 
- Fall datasets
- Activities of Daily Living (ADL) datasets  

This way, we can differentiate what is a fall and what is just a normal human movement.
